📖 About This Project
Cosmos 1.0 presents a novel methodology for mapping emerging technologies using large-scale textual data from Wikipedia and other sources. We introduce the ET23k dataset, consisting of 23,544 emerging technologies, structured into a hierarchical model with three meta clusters (ET3), seven theme clusters (ET7), and a manually curated list of 100 highly relevant emerging technologies (ET100). The dataset includes multiple indices such as:

Technology Awareness Index (based on Wikipedia pageviews)
Generality Index (measuring technology ubiquity)
Deeptech Index (assessing research intensity)
Age of Tech Index (determining the estimated origin year of a technology)
Technology Proximity Index (distinguishing technologies from related concepts)
This dataset and methodology enable a bottom-up approach to technology foresight, complementing traditional top-down expert-driven forecasting methods.
